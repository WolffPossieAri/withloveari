This is my very first letter to you.

Well… not technically my first blog. I tried starting one during my mission, but let’s just say consistency and limited internet access didn’t exactly go hand in hand. Now, with full access to Wi-Fi and an eager heart, I thought I’d give this another shot.
Everyone talks about New Year’s resolutions but I think birthday resolutions should be the new trend.
So here we are.

This one is mine.

To catch you up on my busy little life, I should probably start with my weekdays.
I spend my days caring for six sweet kids at the daycare. Six doesn’t sound like much until you realize three are in diapers, two are potty training, and one is deep in his very serious “why?” phase.

This winter has been strange, the weather unsure of itself. So the kids and I have mostly stayed indoors filling our days with art projects, matching games, singing at full volume, and spontaneous dance parties. But when the sun decides to show up, you’ll find us outside playing catch or hiding behind trees in dramatic games of hide and seek.

It’s loud. It’s messy. It’s beautiful.

One of our youngest, Finley, just started walking and is bravely attempting new words. Watching him follow the older kids copying every jump, sound, and dance move, is one of the sweetest parts of my day. At home he may be the oldest, but with us, he’s our baby.

And speaking of babies…

A few weeks ago, I made what some might call an impulse decision and brought home a puppy. Kona.
She is, without exaggeration, the sweetest little thing. Playful, cuddly, wildly energetic, definitely my kind of dog. Training her with my schedule has been… humbling. And although she’ll soon be rehomed to another loving family, she has completely stolen our hearts.
We’ll never forget her baby hops while playing fetch, her oversized paws, or yes — even her mischievous sock-stealing moments.

And in the middle of all this…

Ashley and I celebrated our birthdays.
Twenty-three and twenty-one.
How did that happen?

We spent one evening in Salt Lake watching the Peter Pan ballet together. Which might officially be our birthday tradition now (last year was Swan Lake). There’s something about sister dates and live music that feels special.
Sunday was family party time! Carne asada, cupcakes, and Just Dance competitions with the people we love most.

It was full.
It was loud.
It was perfect.

After celebrating almost every weekend since November, I think it’s safe to say we’re ready for a slower pace.
As much as I love a full house and a reason to clean it top to bottom, there’s something equally lovely about an unhurried Saturday. Sleeping in. Lingering in pajamas. Letting the day unfold without a schedule. Cuddling the cats while the house stays quiet a little longer than usual.

And maybe that’s what this next year of life is inviting me into, not less joy, just a steadier kind. The kind that doesn’t always need confetti or a calendar reminder. The kind that shows up in ordinary mornings and small, unnoticed moments.
I’m grateful you’re here at the start of this birthday resolution of mine. It feels special to begin something new and not do it alone.
There’s so much more I want to share! The lessons I’m learning, the things I’m trying (even when they don’t go perfectly), and the simple moments that end up meaning the most.

I’m really glad you’re here. Stay tuned!
