This space is where I share the pieces of my testimony that have shaped me. The scriptures that steady my heart, the lessons God is teaching me, and the quiet moments that have strengthened my faith. I don’t have all the answers, but I do know that life is lighter with Him.

My hope is that something you read here brings you comfort, clarity, or a reminder that you’re never walking alone.

Thanks for joining me!
