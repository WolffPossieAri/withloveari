I’ve always been a girl in motion.
With new projects, ideas, and hobbies finding me almost weekly, I’ve never been the type to have nothing on my plate. By day, I work as a director at my family-owned business, which means my schedule is almost always full. But somehow, life feels even fuller in the evenings, and especially when the weekends roll around.

In 2024, I returned home from serving an LDS mission in Cobán, Guatemala, a place that changed me in ways I’m still discovering. There, I learned how to make corn tortillas by hand and how to navigate by mountains instead of street signs (if you know, you know). But more than that, I built a relationship with God that became the anchor of my life.

I’m far from perfect, but I try every day to grow a little softer, a little steadier, and a little more faithful.
Life feels lighter with Him.

And even sweeter with my family.

If you know me at all, you know they are the center of my world. My loving parents and my three little sisters keep my life loud but meaningful. They are my greatest joy and my safest place.

Being in my twenties is thrilling — my world feels like it’s constantly stretching and shifting. But in the middle of all that movement, I’ve learned to treasure stillness too.

You’ll usually find me in the kitchen during those quiet moments — trying a new recipe, baking something warm, or experimenting with flavors I’m not totally confident in yet. I’m not an expert (not even close), but there’s something special about creating something with your hands and sharing it with someone you love.
This space is where I gather all of it! The faith, the family, the growth, the flour on the counter, the lessons I’m learning in real time.
I’m so glad you’re here.

Pull up a chair, stay awhile, and let’s grow together.
